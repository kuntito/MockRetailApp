ui done. two pages, one to view and select items
another to view order summary

the next page would be the payment.
and technically the app is done.

how? how about the backend? i think that's the next thing?
we need data.

well, before that. how about you implement the state management.

how does the item selection work?

what about routing?

i think i'd implement routing first.
it's really two locations now.

after routing, simulate state management with dummy data.

before backend.
