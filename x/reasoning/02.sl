products Api done.

i want to create the admin UI for nihude.

what's the primary job? what does the admin need to do?

she needs to manage items.

add new items.
remove items.
edit items.

can she view orders, i guess she should.
no guess, she manages items.
items get displayed on customer end.

if customer makes an order, it should appear on her screen
one thing i did in the previous version is i allowed items to be disabled.

let's implement the admin interface.

first screen two buttons.

add new item.

manage existing items.

forget two screens.
one screen.

a list of items.
with a switch to indicate which item is available.

for adding new items, use a floating action button.


`finish admin interface`

`make sure inventory CRUD only accepts valid values`
`CRUD operations should return useful error messages`
